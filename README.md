I created a navigation resource file called nav_account. It includes the account fragment and set location fragment. and also I removed them from nav_onboarding.

![account nav](https://github.com/Getir-Android-Kotlin-Bootcamp/getir-android-kotlin-bootcamp-w3-assignment-blaugranaa/assets/24704582/da49acac-fc6e-4522-abee-eea2dcdb449f)


If the `userId` variable in SplashActivity is not null, the login will be considered successful. In such case, the user will be directed to the account page.
If the user has not logged in before, they will be directed to the onboarding screen.
